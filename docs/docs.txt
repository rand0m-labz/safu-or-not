SAFU or NOT Docs

Welcome to the quick rundown of how this little tool works.
Nothing fancy. No complicated nonsense. Just straight info so you know what you are dealing with.

What this tool does

You drop a link into the box
You click Check Safety
We scan the link using a few different checks
Then we give you a clean and simple report before you decide to visit the site

What we check
General Threats

We use public threat detection services to see if the site is known for malware or phishing attempts

Domain Info

We look at the domain age to see if it was just created out of nowhere or has been around for a while

SSL Status

We try to see if the site has a valid certificate
If the SSL info is blocked or unavailable we say Unknown
No guessing here

Wallet Connection Check

We look for connect wallet buttons or common Web3 scripts
If a site looks like it wants your crypto wallet we tell you up front

Redirect Behavior

Some sites try to bounce you through multiple places
If we detect a redirect pattern we let you know

Phishing Pattern Detection

We check the URL for suspicious keywords or tricks that scammers love to use
If something smells off we tell you straight

What this tool does not do

We do not guarantee safety
We do not replace your own judgment
We do not give financial legal or security advice
Always DYOR no matter what
